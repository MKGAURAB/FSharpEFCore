# FSharpEFCore
Just played with EF Core in FSharp
This has a small API Project and the Database Project. Database project has all the Abstraction and implementation of Repository, Context, etc stuffs. The DemoApi project just use this Database project to do CRUD operation.
Made this project to Check out how EF Core works in F#.
